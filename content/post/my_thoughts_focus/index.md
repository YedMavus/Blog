title: Struggles with Focus
date: 2025-05-15

You wake up, feeling exhausted and sleepy. You started going to the gym this week, maybe its that. The least effortful thing you can do now is to turn around and pick up your phone. You do that, check for new texts on WhatsApp. There are a couple, actually.

Your best friend has sent a funny reel on Instagram, you got to see it. You get a good laugh, and by habit, you scroll. And you have begun doom-scrolling.

Right at the beginning of the day, your brain finds, with minimal work of swiping your thumb, you can get mini doses of dopamine, something you used to get out of intense workouts, making a good meal, or getting a good idea.

But now, its just a swipe and you got everything you need.

I saw a YouTube video yesterday titled "Why we can't focus." which started off with the quote: "we are amusing ourselves to death".

This is a huge problem, since right after waking up you have a spike in dopamine, without doing anything worthwhile, and thus your brain has no motivation to get out of bed.

Now picture this - you have fought the urge and got up, freshened up and you sit to look at some papers, or a lecture on youtube. Instinctively you end up doing CTRL+T and open up twitter, or maybe another youtube tab with shorts. You don't get the actual work done, and you are watching short form content.

PS whatever I wrote about in the second person is what I do :)
